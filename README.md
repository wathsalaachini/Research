## Enhancing Ant Colony Optimization by Machine Learning

---


## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Ant colony optimization was introduced in the early 1990s by Marco Dorigo in his PhD thesis. It was specially designed for routing problems, inspired by the behaviour of real ant
  colonies in finding the shortest path between food sources and their nest. They deposit  pheromone on their path which enables them to find shortest paths between their nest and food 
  sources. Ants prefer to choose paths with higher pheromone levels and shorter lengths, similar to the behaviour observed in real ants .
  ACO is generally used for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).However, it can be infrequently adapted to many other problems that donâ€™t belong in the category of routing problems.(Eg:- Graph Coloring Problem, Knapsack Problem, Job Scheduling Problem. Machine Learning (ML) is a broad field that includes a wide range of techniques, methodologies, and applications. 

  ### ðŸ§  The Role of Machine Learning
  
 Sun et al. (2022) introduced a machine learning-enhanced ACO (ML-ACO) algorithm,to enhance the performance of ACO, specially designed for the orienteering problem (OP), a variant of the vehicle routing problems (VRP).

  ## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
  Apply the machine learning-enhanced ant colony optimization algorithm to the TSP and the QUBO to enhance the performance of ACO  in finding high-quality solutions.

  ## Conclusion
   We can conclude that the efficiency of ML enhancement may depend on the structure of the problem and provide better benefits for routing problems such as the TSP, their impact on QUBO problems is more limited.
